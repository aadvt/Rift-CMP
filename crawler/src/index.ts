/**
 * The Rift-CMP website scanner.
 *
 * Discovery, not enforcement. Everything this package produces is an
 * observation: *this cookie was set*, *this host was contacted*, *this script
 * loaded*, under one stated scan configuration. None of it is a legal
 * determination, and nothing here decides what a site is permitted to do.
 *
 * That boundary is the reason the package exists separately from the consent
 * domain. See `docs/crawler.md`.
